## The problem

One of the biggest challenges of coordinating reunions is getting in contact with your class.
The ways classes communicated and set up long-term communication channels changes with the times.

In many cases, classes have their own Facebook groups set up.
In other cases, classes might have had mailing lists, or a class Instagram page, or a WhatsApp group or similar.

Unfortunately, a common issue is that the way people choose to communicate or stay in contact changes significantly between they graduated (and these channels were established) and when they might be looking for reunion information (potentially decades later).
For example, a Facebook group might have been wildly popular in 2008, but group membership may have since dramatically decreased as Facebook has become less popular with that generation.

## A potential solution

One lesser-known resource for both alumni and class presidents is Granite School District's [Alumni Connections](https://www.graniteschools.org/alumni-connections/).

This webpage hosts a form that individuals can fill out to provide their contact information to the School District.
Then, class presidents can access this information by contacting the District's communications department.

In other words, this is one potential way to re-create a connection when an alumni or class president has no other way to contact each other.
