For Cottonwood reunions, Granite School District doesn't charge for the venue itself, only the personnel.
Specifically, they require an administrator and a custodian to be present starting with the set-up time through the take-down.
They also charge an additional 3-4 hours for the custodian to clean up after the event.
The hourly rate for each individual is $50 (at time of writing, subject to change).

In order to request a date, you can use [ML Schedules](https://ut1.mlschedules.com/ReportCalendar.aspx) for Granite School District to submit rental requests.
Note that all requests must be made at least 14 days in advance!

In addition, when you go to set up an account to make a request, it will require that you provide liability insurance before it will let you proceed.
Liability insurance can be acquired from any insurance provider.
Granite School District specifically requires the following.

1. Granite School District must be listed as "Additional Insured" on a primary/non-contributory basis.
2. Limits must be a minimum of $1,000,000 Primary per occurrence and $2,000,000 Aggregate.
3. Email a copy of the Certificate of Liability Insurance to [`rentals@graniteschools.org`](mailto:rentals@graniteschools.org).
