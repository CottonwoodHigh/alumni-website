### 2015 (5-Year Reunion)

- **Location:** Murray Park, 296 E Murray Park Ave, Murray, UT 84107
- **Date & Time:** Saturday, 15 Aug 2015
- **Parking:** Plenty of parking in the lots.

Our [5-year reunion](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/19p26KU8Kz/) was a low-key gathering filled with laughter, ice cream, and good conversation.
It was great to catch up with people, and celebrate all the big decisions and milestones people were preparing to make in terms of school, jobs, family, and life.
Thank you to everyone who attended and made it special!
