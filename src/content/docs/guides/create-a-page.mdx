title: How to Create/Update a Page
description: A how-to guide for creating or updating a class page on the Cottonwood Alumni website.
---

This website is alumni-run and completely [open source](https://github.com/lukehsiao/cottonwood-alumni).
We have an [example class page](../../reference/example-class/) you can look at for inspiration.
With that in mind, there are two primary ways to create or update a class page.

:::note

The initial set of class pages and information were populated from the information on the [official Cottonwood Alumni page](https://schools.graniteschools.org/cottonwoodhigh/alumni/).
Classes with websites that do not load were omitted.
Since then, we've added additional information not present on that page.
We periodically check for updates there and synchronize them here.

## Work with the webmaster

The primary way people create or update a class page is by working with the [webmaster](mailto:admin@cottonwoodhigh.school).
You can email the linked address with your requests, or send something like a Google Doc that the webmaster can work with you to translate onto the website, or even set up a call to work on something together.
Typically, we can get the site updated within 24 hours of your request.

## Open a pull request

For those alumni that have the technical background to feel comfortable opening a [pull request](https://github.com/lukehsiao/cottonwood-alumni/pulls) on GitHub, please feel free to do so!

These pull requests are typically reviewed very quickly, and site updates are published as soon as commits hit main.

We default to using MDX syntax on the pages.
See [writing content in Markdown](../../reference/syntax) for a flavor and the [Starlight docs](https://starlight.astro.build/) for full details.
