This website is alumni-created and built by the community to be a place where alumi can more easily find and share information or news with former classmates.

Yes, [Cottonwood has their own alumni page](https://schools.graniteschools.org/cottonwoodhigh/alumni/), but it only serves to provide small snippets of reunion information.
Similarly, yes, alumniclass.com exists, but it's another "walled-garden", locking information behind creating an account and login.

On this site, alumni can create more full-fledges webpages, allowing them to provide actual reunion details or other useful information.

This site is also completely [open source](https://github.com/lukehsiao/cottonwood-alumni).
