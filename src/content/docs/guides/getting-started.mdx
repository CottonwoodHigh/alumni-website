description: What are these class pages?
---

This website is alumni-created and built by the community to be a place where alumi can more easily find and share information or news with former classmates.

Yes, [Cottonwood has their own alumni page](https://schools.graniteschools.org/cottonwoodhigh/alumni/), but it only serves to provide small snippets of reunion information.

On this site, alumni can create more full-fledges webpages, allowing them to provide actual reunion details or other userful information.

This site is also built in the open and is open source.
