description: How to sponsor and financially support this community-run website.

import { Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This website is developed as a free and open-source project, supported by donations.
We believe that a community-run site like this is able to provide value to our alumni community in a way that neither walled-gardens like Facebook nor the bare-bones district-sponsored website can.
Specifically, it puts the contents and longevity of the site directly in the hands of alumni, rather than at the whims of big corporations or the school.

Aligned with that belief, we develop this website as a non-profit.
Not in the formal sense (we don't have a legal entity), but in the sense that we do it for the community alone—no one is making any money here.

## The costs

As a relatively simple, statically generated website, the costs to operate this are very small.
We host the site on Cloudflare Pages at no cost.
The website and its contents are all developed by volunteers.
Our sole operating expense is for the domain name, which costs $30/year at our DNS registrar, Porkbun.

## The opportunity

This cost is low enough that individuals donating can likely keep this site online for perpetuity.
However, it is also a low-cost opportunity to connect with our community and local businesses for conscientious sponsorships.

With that in mind, we offer businesses and individuals the opportunity to sponsor this website in exchange for their logo being displayed on sponsor section of the homepage.
This logo can link to a URL of their choice.
Currently, we display a logo for one year for every $15 donated (e.g., a $30 donation will secure a logo and link for two years).

<Card title="Support this website" icon="heart">Display a logo for **one year for every $15 donated**.</Card>

In return, this website provides these business exposure to a small amount of web traffic (which typically bursts in the summer months).
While the amount of traffic is small (think 200-300 of unique visitors per month as a non-summer baseline), it is also primarily Cottonwood alumni who are still connected to our local community.

In the spirit of candor, this is a low-cost, but also a low-reward opportunity in terms of marketing.
However, it also is a generous and appreciated gesture for our alumni community.

## Who do I contact?

Those interested in sponsoring this website can email \<[admin@cottonwoodhigh.school](mailto:admin@cottonwoodhigh.school)>.

We reserve the right to refuse sponsorships at our discretion.

## Sponsor materials

If we determine that the sponsorship is a good match, we will ask for the following:

1. **Two logos in SVG format.**
   One should be optimized for "light mode", one should be optimized for "dark mode".
   If the logo was designed to work well for both situations, a single SVG is fine.
2. **The URL the logo should link.**

:::tip
We embed the logos in a 4:1 (width:height) rectangular area.
So, consider choosing a logo that more optimally fills that space.
For example, a rectangular, full logo is likely a better fit than a square icon.
