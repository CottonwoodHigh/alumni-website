title: Introduction
description: An introduction to Cottonwood Alumni class pages.
---

This website is alumni-run and built by the community to be a place where alumni can more easily find and publish public information or news with former classmates.

Yes, [Cottonwood has their own alumni page](https://schools.graniteschools.org/cottonwoodhigh/alumni/), but it only serves to provide small snippets of reunion information.
Similarly, yes, alumniclass.com and other similar services exist, but they are all "walled-gardens", locking information behind creating an account and logging in.
They also collect an uncomfortable amount of personal data.

On this site, alumni can create more full-fledged webpages, allowing them to provide actual reunion details and useful information.
The goal is to support high-quality webpages for each class (e.g., no more need to create Google Sites or similar), but you can also publish links to other sites if you'd rather direct people elsewhere.
That said, we do NOT want to publish or collect any excessive personal information (e.g., information beyond contact points or other public information).
For example, all email addresses listed on this site are protected from bots via [Cloudflare email address obfuscation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/).
This is not intended to replace a forum, mailing list, or social media site.
We hope the site facilitates real connections where that type of information can be shared directly among friends.

This site is completely [open source](https://github.com/lukehsiao/cottonwood-alumni).

:::tip[Why is my class missing?]

Not every class has any public, working information.
Class pages were initially seeded from the [Cottonwood alumni page](https://schools.graniteschools.org/cottonwoodhigh/alumni/), but if no information was available, the page was omitted.
